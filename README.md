# Resume-Revise-InsightHub 

## Problem Statement

Navigating the job application process can be challenging, with resumes acting as the key document representing us to HR professionals. Facing rejection without feedback can be disheartening, prompting me to channel this challenge into motivation for my project. I got inspired and created an application leveraging Google's generative AI, [GEMINI], to offer feedback on job applications. The tool identifies missing keywords in resumes, aiming to enhance their effectiveness.
## Objectives

- To offer a user-friendly tool enabling job seekers to align their resumes with job descriptions effectively.
- To harness cutting-edge AI technology for analyzing and giving feedback on resumes.
- To present a straightforward interface that streamlines the resume review process.
